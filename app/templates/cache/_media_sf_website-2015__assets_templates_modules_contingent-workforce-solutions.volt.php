							<p>Every business benefits from contractors, consultants and temporary workers. Whether you need a single worker or you have a large contingent workforce that you rely to deliver your business, we have a solution to ensure your contingent workforce is cost effective and quality assured.</p>
							<p>Contingent workers bring different challenges to permanent employees.  They bring you distinct legal and contractual obligations.  They operate under diverse pay scales, tax treatment and payment terms. They are transient and difficult to keep track of.  An inability to keep on top of these challenges can reduce their effectiveness and your return on investment.</p>
							<p>We have specialist contingent workforce teams in each of our locations, with experience in managing all types of worker engagement, from a single temp to an entire contingent workforce.  We take care of your contingent workforce and let you focus on developing your business.</p>
